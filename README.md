# Economy_game
Small project to test a game idea I had for import/export trading concepts

This game is a work in progress with the intent to test and design concepts
that would be interesting and fun.

The game includes things like:
  Trading
  Production
  Player driven value/economy
  Dynamic markets
  
Eventually I may take the game to actual production, and in this event it
will probably not include many of the features shown during the progression
of this project.
